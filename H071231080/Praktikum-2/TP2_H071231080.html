                <h1>I'm a Princess Rapunzel from Tangled. i'm the best üëë</h1>
                <p>Princess Rapunzel is the protagonist of Disney's 2010 animated feature film Tangled. 
                    She is the princess of the kingdom of Corona, 
                    known for her long, magical, golden hair. 
                    As a baby, Rapunzel was abducted by a wicked 
                    crone and locked away in a remote tower for 
                    18 years‚Äîduring which, 
                    she became fascinated with a phenomenon involving "floating lights" that would only appear on her birthday. With the aid of the handsome thief Flynn Rider, Rapunzel escaped her tower to learn more about the lights and pursue her dream of exploring the outside world.</p>

                <div class="about-content">
                        <p>A few years later, a prince rides through the forest and hears Rapunzel singing from the tower. Entranced by her ethereal voice, 
                            he searches for her and discovers the tower, but is unable to enter it. The prince returns to the tower often, listening to 
                            Rapunzel's beautiful singing, and one day sees the sorceress visit her as usual and learns how to gain access. 
                            When the sorceress leaves, the prince bids Rapunzel to let her hair down. Thinking it is the sorceress calling her again, 
                            Rapunzel lets down her hair and the prince climbs up. </p>
                            
                        <p>Before the couple's escape plan can come to fruition, however, the sorceress visits one day and Rapunzel innocently asks her why 
                            all her clothes are tight around the waist (this part comes from the 1812 original edition of Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen or 
                        Children's and Household Tales, most commonly known in English as Grimms' Fairy Tales;[13] in later editions, Rapunzel
                        instead asks "Dame Gothel",[g] in a moment of forgetfulness, why it is easier for her to draw up the prince than her[15]). 
                        In anger, the sorceress cuts off Rapunzel's hair and banishes her into the wilderness to fend for herself.</p>
